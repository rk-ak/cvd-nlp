Create term document matrix, term frequencies - unigrams, bigrams and trigrams and emotions from a covid-19 survey, using R script.

Here, we will see an R script used to perform the following activities on a survey for example - from an covid-19 general survey.

First, we will clean the survey data so that we can use it for further analysis, like - removing unwanted characters or numbers, converting to lowercase, removing stop words, and then stemming to create a corpus.

Next, we will create term document matrix and term frequencies - mainly unigram, bigrams and trigrams.

Finally, if we can do sentiment anlysis if available in the survey data.
